# Security Policy

## üîí Security Considerations

NillionVault is designed with security as a primary concern. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Encrypted Storage**: All credential data is encrypted using Nillion SecretVaults
- **No Plaintext Storage**: Sensitive data is never stored in plaintext
- **Secure Transmission**: All API communications use HTTPS
- **Access Control**: Row-level security policies in database

### Blockchain Security
- **Immutable Anchoring**: Proof hashes are anchored to nilChain testnet
- **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify credentials independently
- **Reproducible Proofs**: Canonical hashing ensures consistency
- **Audit Trail**: Complete operation logging

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have rate limiting protection
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS settings for security

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO** email security concerns to: [your-email@domain.com]
3. **DO** include detailed reproduction steps
4. **DO** provide your contact information

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability within 7 days
3. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and provide updates
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure if appropriate

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- **API Keys**: Keep your Nillion API keys secure and rotate them regularly
- **Private Keys**: Store wallet private keys securely offline
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production environments

### For Developers
- **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated
- **Code Review**: All code changes should be reviewed
- **Testing**: Run security tests before deployment
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activity

### For Deployment
- **Environment Security**: Secure all environment variables
- **Database Security**: Use strong passwords and connection encryption
- **Network Security**: Use proper firewall and network security
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring

## üîç Security Audit

### Regular Checks
- **Dependency Audits**: Regular npm audit checks
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scans

### External Audits
We plan to conduct external security audits as the project matures.
