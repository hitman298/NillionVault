# How to Get 28 NIL Tokens for NillionVault

You need 28 NIL tokens to subscribe to the nilDB service. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Contact Nillion Team (Recommended)

### For Developers & Builders:
1. **Join Nucleus Builders Program**: https://nucleus.nillion.com
   - This is Nillion's official developer program
   - Provides grants and additional testnet tokens
   - Perfect for projects like NillionVault

2. **Community Support**: https://docs.nillion.com/community-and-support
   - Reach out via Discord or other channels
   - Explain you're building NillionVault
   - Request additional testnet tokens for development

3. **GitHub Issues**: If you're contributing to Nillion projects
   - Show your work on NillionVault
   - Request tokens for testing

### What to Include in Your Request:
```
Subject: Request for Additional NIL Testnet Tokens - NillionVault Project

Hi Nillion Team,

I'm building NillionVault, a credential anchoring system that:
- Stores encrypted credentials in Nillion SecretVaults
- Anchors proof hashes to nilChain testnet
- Provides public verification capabilities

I need 28+ NIL tokens to subscribe to the nilDB service for testing.

Wallet Address: [your_wallet_address]
Project Repository: [your_repo_url]
Use Case: Educational/demonstration of Nillion's capabilities

Thank you for your support!
```

## Option 2: Wait for Faucet (Not Practical)

- Faucet gives 0.1 NIL every 24 hours
- To get 28 NIL: 0.1 Ã— 280 = 280 days
- This is not practical for development

## Option 3: Alternative Development Approach

If you can't get tokens immediately, you can still develop and test:

### Mock Implementation:
1. Use the current mock Nillion service
2. Develop all other features (frontend, database, etc.)
3. Test the complete flow without real blockchain
4. Switch to real services once you get tokens

### Test with Other Services:
1. Set up Supabase database
2. Set up Upstash Redis queue
3. Test file upload and verification flow
4. Add real Nillion integration later

## Step-by-Step Token Request Process

### 1. Prepare Your Project
- Make sure NillionVault is well-documented
- Show working code and features
- Demonstrate the value proposition

### 2. Contact Methods (in order of preference):
1. **Nucleus Builders Program** (most likely to succeed)
2. **Discord Community** (fastest response)
3. **GitHub Issues** (if contributing to Nillion projects)
4. **Email/Direct Contact** (if you have connections)

### 3. Be Specific About Your Needs:
- Exact number of tokens needed (28+ for nilDB subscription)
- Your wallet address
- Timeline for development
- How you'll use the tokens

## What Happens After You Get Tokens

### 1. Subscribe to nilDB Service:
- Go to https://nilpay.vercel.app/
- Connect your wallet
- Subscribe to nilDB (28 NIL/month)
- Get your API key

### 2. Update NillionVault:
- Add API key to backend/.env
- Install real Secretvaults SDK
- Test with real Nillion infrastructure

### 3. Full Blockchain Integration:
- Real encrypted storage in nilDB nodes
- Real transactions on nilChain testnet
- Public verification via blockchain explorer

## Success Stories

Many developers have successfully requested additional testnet tokens by:
- Showing genuine interest in the platform
- Building meaningful projects
- Contributing to the ecosystem
- Following the proper channels

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Professional**: Write a clear, concise request
2. **Show Your Work**: Provide links to your project
3. **Explain the Value**: How does your project benefit the ecosystem?
4. **Be Patient**: Response times vary
5. **Follow Up**: If no response in a week, try another channel

## Backup Plan

If you can't get additional tokens:
1. **Demo Mode**: Use mock services for demonstrations
2. **Educational Content**: Focus on explaining the concepts
3. **Community Contribution**: Help other developers
4. **Wait for Mainnet**: Real tokens will be available later
